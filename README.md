## Some Notes

Might need to change the database to store the graph - requiring export in addition to import (bulk insert).

- But first need to have the graph to be built based on the same data type;
- Then I need to expand current data type to maintain a record of timestamps, timestamps of last change;
- Then I need to migrate this to work with a permanent storage - either relational or graph database.

Grag database would be preferable since I would learn how to work with them and that's the actual structure of what we have here ...
